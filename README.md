# Data Cleaning and Logistic Regression on Public Kickstarter Data

For this project, the goal was to develop experience cleaning, formatting, analyzing, and modeling data using pandas in Python.

## Background


## Installation
I personally use Anaconda for all of my python package management.
Packages required for data cleaning and editing are the following
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
import seaborn as sns
import os 
from datetime import datetime
```
